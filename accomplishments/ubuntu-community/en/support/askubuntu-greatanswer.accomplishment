	Don't just answer the question, go above in beyond by explaining how you solved the problem, take this opportunity to teach a user how to find this kind of information. 
pitfalls: Many questions are low quality, a great answer needs a great question, so concentrate on finding a highly voted unanswered question to answer. 
	Many poor questions are just duplicates of other more established questions, double check with a search before you invest time in a great answer; it can be frustrating to waste time writing a great answer to a question that will be closed/removed as a duplicate.  
	Don't link to random blogs or websites, those resources are typically unable to be reviewed and updated by the community and often have out of date information.
