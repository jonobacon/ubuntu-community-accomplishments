#. ENGLISH TRANSLATION:
#. A <i>bug</i> is a defect in a piece of software. When you report a bug it means that you let the Ubuntu project know about one of these defects so we can resolve it.
#. When you report a bug it starts a conversation with developers and other interested parties to help identify the cause of the problem to provide enough information so the developer can resolve it. This conversation can often involve the developer(s) asking you various questions to help track down the cause of the issue.
#. This conversation takes place in a <i>bug tracker</i>; a tool that provides features for having this conversation, and setting  prioritization fields to ensure that the most disruptive bugs get resolved sooner than more more benign issues.
#. There are a few different ways in which you can file a bug, but we recommend you use a tool called <tt>ubuntu-bug</tt> that comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu systems. This tool helps gather up neccessary information that can be useful for the developer to find the source of the bug so they can resolve it.
#. You can file a bug in a more graphical way by using the <i>Report a Problem</i> option in the <i>Help</i> menu of an application; this simply provides a graphical way of running <tt>ubuntu-bug</tt>.

#. File a bug as you would normally (see the Filed First Bug accomplishments for more details) and ensure that the description is detailed enough to enable others to reproduce it. To write a good bug report, include the following:
#. A clear and concise description of the problem. Don't forget to mention whether the bug can be triggered every time or whether it is intermittent.
#. A set of steps to reproduce the problem. Make sure that they are explicit. For instance, if a step involves selecting a menu item, specify whether selecting it using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts makes a difference.
#. A description of the failure when following those steps.
#. A description of what you expected the application to do instead. This is an important piece of information: sometimes, what the application does is what the developers expected it to do and they didn't realise it would cause you problems so describing what you expect is helpful to understand the defect.
#. Any additional information you think can help diagnose the problem. For instance, if the application used to work and suddenly stopped working, specify when it started mis-behaving.
