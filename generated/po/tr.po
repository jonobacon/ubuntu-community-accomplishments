#. ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
#. The Bug Squad is Ubuntu's team for helping out with improving bug reports.  The Bug Squad is the first point of contact for the bugs filed about Ubuntu.  Members assign bugs to packages, ensure that bug reports are complete, find duplicate bug reports, recreate bugs, and forward bugs to their upstream authors. All of these activities help bugs get fixed and subsequently make Ubuntu even better.
#. What the Bug Squad does is also known as Triaging, which is similar to the process of prioritizing patients in a hospital based on the severity of their condition. This allows developers to spend their time more effectively, and is a great way to learn about how Ubuntu works as an operating system and as a community. It's also not uncommon for triagers to discover new and interesting features they didn't know about.

#. Downvoting too often. You lose 1 reputation each time you downvote, and if you lose too much reputation you could also lose your privilege to downvote temporarily. Also, for some posts a comment or an edit might suffice instead, while for other posts where the content is against site policy it might be better to flag it so a moderator can be deal with it appropriately.

#. Posting a comment instead of an answer. Your post does not count as an answer unless it is actually posted as such. If you need help making sure you are posting properly, check out the link to the FAQ at the top of the page.
#. Posting a poor quality answer. Poor quality answers may be unclear, inaccurate or unhelpful in some way, and may be voted down instead of up. Review your answer carefully for clarity and accuracy before posting.
#. Posting nothing but a link as an answer. If the link were to stop working, such an answer would become effectively worthless. Summarize your source in your answer, and provide the link as a reference.
#. Posting a "me too" answer. These types of answers are not helpful to those looking for information, and disrupt Ask Ubuntu's Q&A format. If you are having the same problem, wait for a working answer to appear, or leave a comment on answers that don't work for you. You may also try sharing the question to see if someone you know can properly answer it, or asking a new question if yours could be sufficiently different to warrant a different answer for it.
#. Posting spam or answers which violate community guidelines. These often attract large numbers of down votes and are flagged by other users for removal by moderators.

#. You can now propose that your branch is merged into another branch. This means that the owner of the original branch that you improved will contribute your improvements to it, this merging in your work.

#. A clear and concise description of the problem. Don't forget to mention whether the bug can be triggered every time or whether it is intermittent.
#. A set of steps to reproduce the problem. Make sure that they are explicit. For instance, if a step involves selecting a menu item, specify whether selecting it using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts makes a difference.
#. A description of the failure when following those steps.
#. A description of what you expected the application to do instead. This is an important piece of information: sometimes, what the application does is what the developers expected it to do and they didn't realise it would cause you problems so describing what you expect is helpful to understand the defect.
#. Any additional information you think can help diagnose the problem. For instance, if the application used to work and suddenly stopped working, specify when it started mis-behaving.

#. First Tag Wiki Edit. Ask Ubuntu has tags that split questions into different groups. These tags allow the site to remain organized and help users by allowing them to subscribe to or ignore topics they might find interesting or wish to ignore. Each tag has an associated wiki page called a tag wiki. This page describes the tag, how it's used on the site, and anything the community might find useful about that topic. It is the bridge for that subject between Ask Ubuntu and other canonical references to the subject on the internet, the ideal tag wiki contains many links to other resources.

#. <a href="http://planet.ubuntu.com">Planet Ubuntu</a> is a website that lists blogs (personal websites) of people involved in the Ubuntu project and our various flavors.
#. Planet Ubuntu has become a very popular resource for our community and beyond to keep up to date with what is happening in the project. It brings together many, many blogs from across the community and the world into a single webpage that is convenient for browsing.
#. Planet Ubuntu works by users adding their blog's RSS feeds (most blogs have an RSS feed that you can use) which will take just the content from the blog and embed it into Planet Ubuntu.
#. To have your blog listed on Planet Ubuntu you need to first become an <i>Ubuntu Member</i>.

#. Now use <tt>bzr</tt> to download the Planet Ubuntu branch: bzr checkout lp:~planet-ubuntu/config/main planet-ubuntu
#. You will need to create small image called a <i>Hackergotchi</i> (this is usually of your head). This should be about 100x100 pixels in size. Copy it to the heads directory and ensure the filename is your username: <tt>cp ~/hackergotchi.png heads/yourusername.png</tt>
#. Now add your hackergotchi to the branch: <tt>bzr add heads/yourusername.png</tt>
#. Now add the end of the <tt>config.ini</tt> file add a line for your blog in square brackets: e.g. <tt>[[http://blog.example.com/~yourusername/feed?category=ubuntu-only]]</tt>

#. The <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/conduct">Ubuntu Code of Conduct</a> applies to all actions by Ubuntu members, including posting to their blogs.
#. As a rule of thumb, English should be considered the "lingua franca" of Planet Ubuntu. There are a number of language and locale specific Planets run by Ubuntu LoCo Teams, which are a great way for teams to get news out in their local language. However, the official Ubuntu Planet should attempt to use English where possible to reach the widest possible audience.
#. Ubuntu members who publish blogs on Planet Ubuntu should endeavour to ensure that company confidential information is not posted there. The planet administrators will make a reasonable judgement about the sensitivity of information in blogs re-published there, and will consider requests for the removal of content on those grounds. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish the confidentiality of any given piece of information, and will not automatically remove posts on request.
#. If you do need something removing, you can contact the sysadmin team at <a href="mailto:rt@ubuntu.com">rt@ubuntu.com</a>.

#. ACCOMPLISHMENT: Report First Bug ('summary' field)
#. .
#. ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
#. A <i>bug</i> is a defect in a piece of software. When you report a bug it means that you let the Ubuntu project know about one of these defects so we can resolve it.
#. When you report a bug it starts a conversation with developers and other interested parties to help identify the cause of the problem to provide enough information so the developer can resolve it. This conversation can often involve the developer(s) asking you various questions to help track down the cause of the issue.
#. This conversation takes place in a <i>bug tracker</i>; a tool that provides features for having this conversation, and setting  prioritization fields to ensure that the most disruptive bugs get resolved sooner than more more benign issues.
#. There are a few different ways in which you can file a bug, but we recommend you use a tool called <tt>ubuntu-bug</tt> that comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu systems. This tool helps gather up neccessary information that can be useful for the developer to find the source of the bug so they can resolve it.
#. You can file a bug in a more graphical way by using the <i>Report a Problem</i> option in the <i>Help</i> menu of an application; this simply provides a graphical way of running <tt>ubuntu-bug</tt>.

#. ACCOMPLISHMENT: Uploaded First Branch To Launchpad ('summary' field)
#. .
#. ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
#. A core part of Launchpad is the ability to host different directories of code. These directories are called <i>branches</i> and we use the Bazaar version control system to manage them. We can use these branches to share contributions and to propose improvements and changes to other branches and projects.
#. This trophy is awarded when you have created and uploaded your very first branch. We will help you get started right away!
#. It is recommended that you read a quick primer on how version control works. See the <i>Further Reading</i> section below for some helpful links

#. ACCOMPLISHMENT: Uploaded First Branch To Launchpad ('steps' field)
#. .
#. ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
#. You first need to create some code that you want to upload to Launchpad. We are going to presume you have a directory with code in it that you want to use.
#. Load a terminal and change directories to the directory with the branch in it (e.g. <tt>cd mydir</tt>).
#. We first need to initialize the directory so it can be used in bazaar. This is as simple as running <tt>bzr init</tt>. Now we are tracking this directory with Bazaar.
#. We now need to add the files in the directory to Bazaar so that it tracks changes. Do this by running <tt>bzr add</tt>. Whenever you add new files be sure to run <tt>bzr add</tt> again.
#. Whenever you change anything in the directory (such as editing code), you need to commit the changes. Do this by running <tt>bzr commit</tt>. A text editor will open where you can enter the changes (if your default text editor is Nano, save your changes with <i>Ctrl-O</i> and then <i>Ctrl-X</i>).
#. We are now ready to upload your branch to Launchpad. This is known as <i>pushing</i> a branch. To do this type <tt>bzr push lp:~<your-username>/+junk/<name></tt> (for example: <tt>bzr push lp:~bob/+junk/my-first-branch</tt>). Please note your branch name can be anything; it does not need to be the same name as the directory with your code in it.
#. You can now go to your Launchpad profile, click <i>Code</i> and see the branch.

#. The Ubuntu Membership Board is responsible for awarding Ubuntu Membership to community contributors.
#. Those sitting on membership boards are people who are insightful. They are current Ubuntu Members with a proven track record of activity in the community. They have shown themselves over time to be able to work well with others and display the positive aspects of the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. They should be people who can discern character and judge contribution quality without emotion while engaging in an interview/discussion that communicates interest, a welcoming atmosphere, and which is marked by humanity, gentleness, and kindness. Even when they must deny applications, they should do so in such a way that applicants walk away with a sense of hopefulness and a desire to return with a more complete application rather than feeling discouraged or hurt.
#. Try not to be on more than one council (e.g. Community Council, Technical Board) at the same time. Join one, and give it your full attention.

#. First down vote
#. Voting down is how the Ask Ubuntu community indicates which questions and answers are least useful. Use your downvotes whenever you encounter an egregiously sloppy, no-effort-expended post, or an answer that is clearly and perhaps dangerously incorrect.
#. You have a limited number of votes per day and answer downvotes cost you a tiny bit of reputation on top of that so use them wisely. Normally, you should focus on pushing great content to the top by upvoting: this is why downvoting should on the contrary be reserved for extreme cases. It is not meant as a substitute for communication and editing.
#. Instead of voting down, consider flagging the post if it is spammy or offensive, or flagging it for moderator attention if the question is duplicate or off-topic. Always leave a comment for the poster and the community or edit the post to correct it.
