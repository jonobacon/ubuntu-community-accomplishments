#. A clear and concise description of the problem. Don't forget to mention whether the bug can be triggered every time or whether it is intermittent.
#. A set of steps to reproduce the problem. Make sure that they are explicit. For instance, if a step involves selecting a menu item, specify whether selecting it using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts makes a difference.
#. A description of the failure when following those steps.
#. A description of what you expected the application to do instead. This is an important piece of information: sometimes, what the application does is what the developers expected it to do and they didn't realise it would cause you problems so describing what you expect is helpful to understand the defect.
#. Any additional information you think can help diagnose the problem. For instance, if the application used to work and suddenly stopped working, specify when it started mis-behaving.

#. ACCOMPLISHMENT: Report First Bug ('summary' field)
#. .
#. ENGLISH TRANSLATION:
#. A <i>bug</i> is a defect in a piece of software. When you report a bug it means that you let the Ubuntu project know about one of these defects so we can resolve it.
#. When you report a bug it starts a conversation with developers and other interested parties to help identify the cause of the problem to provide enough information so the developer can resolve it. This conversation can often involve the developer(s) asking you various questions to help track down the cause of the issue.
#. This conversation takes place in a <i>bug tracker</i>; a tool that provides features for having this conversation, and setting  prioritization fields to ensure that the most disruptive bugs get resolved sooner than more more benign issues.
#. There are a few different ways in which you can file a bug, but we recommend you use a tool called <tt>ubuntu-bug</tt> that comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu systems. This tool helps gather up neccessary information that can be useful for the developer to find the source of the bug so they can resolve it.
#. You can file a bug in a more graphical way by using the <i>Report a Problem</i> option in the <i>Help</i> menu of an application; this simply provides a graphical way of running <tt>ubuntu-bug</tt>.

There are a number of language and locale specific Planets run by Ubuntu LoCo Teams, which are a great way for teams to get news out in their local language. However, the official Ubuntu Planet should attempt to use English where possible to reach the widest possible audience.
#. Ubuntu members who publish blogs on Planet Ubuntu should endeavour to ensure that company confidential information is not posted there. The planet administrators will make a reasonable judgement about the sensitivity of information in blogs re-published there, and will consider requests for the removal of content on those grounds. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish the confidentiality of any given piece of information, and will not automatically remove posts on request.

#. The Bug Squad is Ubuntu's team for helping out with improving bug reports.  The Bug Squad is the first point of contact for the bugs filed about Ubuntu.  Members assign bugs to packages, ensure that bug reports are complete, find duplicate bug reports, recreate bugs, and forward bugs to their upstream authors. All of these activities help bugs get fixed and subsequently make Ubuntu even better.
#. What the Bug Squad does is also known as Triaging, which is similar to the process of prioritizing patients in a hospital based on the severity of their condition. This allows developers to spend their time more effectively, and is a great way to learn about how Ubuntu works as an operating system and as a community. It's also not uncommon for triagers to discover new and interesting features they didn't know about.

#. A core part of Launchpad is the ability to host different branches of code (using the Bazaar version control system) and for other people to propose improvements and changes to those branches.
#. What commonly happens here is that you <i>branch</i> the code from launchpad (for example, running <tt>bzr branch lp:the-project</tt>) and this downloads the current main branch to your computer. You then work on improvements to that branch and commit your changes using <tt>bzr commit</tt>. You then upload your changes to Launchpad using <tt>bzr push</tt> so others can see your work.
#. You can now propose that your branch is merged into another branch. This means that the owner of the original branch that you improved will contribute your improvements to it, this merging in your work.
#. This trophy is awarded when you have successfully had one of your branches merged into another branch.
