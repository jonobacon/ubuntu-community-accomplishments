// Questions must be at least 2 days old to be eligible for a bounty.
// There can only be 1 active bounty per question at any given time.
// Users must have at least 75 reputation to offer a bounty, and may only have a maximum of 3 active bounties at any given time.
// The bounty period lasts 7 days. Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least 1 day. After the bounty ends, there is a grace period of 24 hours to manually award the bounty.
// If you do not award your bounty within 7 days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with at least 2 upvotes will be awarded half the bounty amount. If there's no answer meeting that criteria, the bounty is not awarded to anyone.
// If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer during the bounty period, and the bounty expires without an explicit award - it is assumed the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration.
