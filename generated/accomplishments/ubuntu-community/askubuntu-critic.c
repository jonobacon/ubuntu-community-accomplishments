// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// First down vote
// Voting down is how the Ask Ubuntu community indicates which questions and answers are least useful. Use your downvotes whenever you encounter an egregiously sloppy, no-effort-expended post, or an answer that is clearly and perhaps dangerously incorrect.
// You have a limited number of votes per day — and answer downvotes cost you a tiny bit of reputation on top of that — so use them wisely. Normally, you should focus on pushing great content to the top by upvoting: this is why downvoting should on the contrary be reserved for extreme cases. It is not meant as a substitute for communication and editing.
// Instead of voting down, consider flagging the post if it is spammy or offensive, or flagging it for moderator attention if the question is duplicate or off-topic. Always leave a comment for the poster and the community or edit the post to correct it.
