// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// Asked a question with no votes, no answers, no comments, and low views for a week. This badge means that few people have even bothered to read your question. This is usually because the title to your question is not detailed enough and your question has scrolled off the front page and into obscurity. With some quick edits you can quickly turn this badge from a consolation prize into a solid start for getting an answer to your question.

// Introduce the accomplishment, explain what the different concepts are that are involved, and provide guidance on how to accomplish it.

// Each edit bumps your question to the top of the site, giving you another shot at an answer. Since each of your edits add more information the more edits you do the better your question will become.
