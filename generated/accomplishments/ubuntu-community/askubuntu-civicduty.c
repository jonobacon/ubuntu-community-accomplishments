// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// Voting is every user's right and <i>civic duty</i> on the site. By voting you help to sort the poor quality and bad posts from the exceptional and high quality posts. While voting is a practice employed on the site it can come with a price.
// Upvoting will cost you no reputation and will increase the reputation of the user you voted for anywhere from 2-10 points depending on the type of post. However, downvotes operate slightly differently. If you downvote an answer the user will be inflicted with -5 reputation points, though you will also take a -2 reputation point penalty. This is designed to avoid abuse of downvotes. If you downvote a question you'll take no hit in reputation.
// This accomplishment and badge is designed to award those who vote in either direction. Vote in either direction (up or down) more than 300 times to earn this.
