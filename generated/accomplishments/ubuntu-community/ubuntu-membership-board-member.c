// ACCOMPLISHMENT: Ubuntu Membership Board Member ('summary' field)
// .
// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// The Ubuntu Membership Board is responsible for awarding Ubuntu Membership to community contributors.
// Those sitting on membership boards are people who are insightful. They are current Ubuntu Members with a proven track record of activity in the community. They have shown themselves over time to be able to work well with others and display the positive aspects of the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. They should be people who can discern character and judge contribution quality without emotion while engaging in an interview/discussion that communicates interest, a welcoming atmosphere, and which is marked by humanity, gentleness, and kindness. Even when they must deny applications, they should do so in such a way that applicants walk away with a sense of hopefulness and a desire to return with a more complete application rather than feeling discouraged or hurt.
