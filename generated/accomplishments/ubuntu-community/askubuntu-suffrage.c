// New users need a certain amount of reputation before they can vote. You can earn this reputation by participating in other ways, such as by answering questions. Note that if you lose reputation later and fall below the minimum needed to vote, you'll lose this privilege until you earn it again - be careful!
// You can also earn the Supporter and Critic badges along the way when you are working on achieving this badge. They are awarded on your first up and down votes, respectively.
// If you do downvote a post, it might be a good idea to leave a comment for the author explaining why you downvoted it and offering a way they can fix it. You can remove your downvote later if they edit their content and sufficiently improve it.

// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// Not downvoting enough. Don't be afraid to disagree with the content of a post! Downvotes provide a way to anonymously disapprove with the content of a post, whether its content is incorrect or not useful.
// Voting for the sake of voting. Votes are used to help separate good content from poor content. Ask yourself if the post really deserves an upvote or a downvote before you cast it.
// Downvoting too often. You lose 1 reputation each time you downvote, and if you lose too much reputation you could also lose your privilege to downvote temporarily. Also, for some posts a comment or an edit might suffice instead, while for other posts where the content is against site policy it might be better to flag it so a moderator can be deal with it appropriately.
