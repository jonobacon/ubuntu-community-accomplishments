// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// Look for questions you are knowledgeable on to answer. If you don't know enough about the problem to come up with a good solution to it, skip the question and try finding another one.
// Use the provided formatting tools or Markdown formatting code to make your answer appear organized and polished.
// Be sure to include sufficient detail in your answer, and assume they don't know anything beyond what is indicated in the question. Questions and answers are browsed by Ubuntu users of all skill levels, and the best answers are those which can be read and understood by a wide audience, not just the user who posted the question.

// ACCOMPLISHMENT: Teacher on Ask Ubuntu ('pitfalls' field)
// .
// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// Posting a comment instead of an answer. Your post does not count as an answer unless it is actually posted as such. If you need help making sure you are posting properly, check out the link to the FAQ at the top of the page.
// Posting a poor quality answer. Poor quality answers may be unclear, inaccurate or unhelpful in some way, and may be voted down instead of up. Review your answer carefully for clarity and accuracy before posting.
// Posting nothing but a link as an answer. If the link were to stop working, such an answer would become effectively worthless. Summarize your source in your answer, and provide the link as a reference.
// Posting a "me too" answer. These types of answers are not helpful to those looking for information, and disrupt Ask Ubuntu's Q&A format. If you are having the same problem, wait for a working answer to appear, or leave a comment on answers that don't work for you. You may also try sharing the question to see if someone you know can properly answer it, or asking a new question if yours could be sufficiently different to warrant a different answer for it.
// Posting spam or answers which violate community guidelines. These often attract large numbers of down votes and are flagged by other users for removal by moderators.
