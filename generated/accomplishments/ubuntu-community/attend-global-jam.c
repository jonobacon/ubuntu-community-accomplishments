// * Head over to a public place (like a local coffee shop, etc) where you'll hang out.
// * Wear something with the Ubuntu logo or have a visible Ubuntu sticker on your laptop (if you bring one).
// * When/if you show up, you agree to the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.
// * Anyone can start an Ubuntu Hour, anywhere, anytime.
