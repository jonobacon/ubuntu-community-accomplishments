// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// The Bug Squad is Ubuntu's team for helping out with improving bug reports.  The Bug Squad is the first point of contact for the bugs filed about Ubuntu.  Members assign bugs to packages, ensure that bug reports are complete, find duplicate bug reports, recreate bugs, and forward bugs to their upstream authors. All of these activities help bugs get fixed and subsequently make Ubuntu even better.
// What the Bug Squad does is also known as Triaging, which is similar to the process of prioritizing patients in a hospital based on the severity of their condition. This allows developers to spend their time more effectively, and is a great way to learn about how Ubuntu works as an operating system and as a community. It's also not uncommon for triagers to discover new and interesting features they didn't know about.
