// ORIGINAL TRANSLATION:
// Many questions are of low quality, a great answer needs a great question, so concentrate on finding a highly voted unanswered question to answer.
// Many poor questions are just duplicates of other more established questions, double check with a search before you invest time in a great answer; it can be frustrating to waste time writing a great answer to a question that will be closed/removed as a duplicate.
// Don't link to random blogs or websites, those resources are typically unable to be reviewed and updated by the community and often have out of date information. If an answer only contains a link, it typically gets deleted.
